## How it works

It is a REST API to store tasks through 3 fields, id, task and done, which is a boolean data type to handle the status of tasks.

All HTTP requests work through a lambda, there is a lambda for each type of request, get, post, put and delete, in the same way there are 4 endpoints for each type of HTTP request.

Additionally, they have an X-Ray trace configured that points to a group of CloudWatch logs.
